# game-5-strikes
A riddle game with fairly simple rules. 

You will be allotted any word out of 5 based on the number you select. 
You then get a clue about that word and have 5 chances to get it right.
Beware! 5 strikes and you are out!

The game is built by defining 2 functions and uses control statements and switch case.
<string.h> is also included along with <stdio.h> since the game deals with strings, i.e. words.
